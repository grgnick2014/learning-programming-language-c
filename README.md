# learning-programming-language-c
Journey with c language to make a strong foundation

I first learned about the history of C like who made it and how it was made.
Then i started with simple c programs and learning how to make it but not writing anything just looking and learning.
I also learned ASCII code, tokens and variable declaration
After that i learned data types, format specifiers and loops such as if, while and for.
After that i did switch case control, operators and nested if else and if else ladder.
Then i learned a bit of nested loops and star control patterns.
The most recent thing i learned about was functions in C. Making different projects using functions such as adding numbers so one add function and a main one while i was learning funtions i also learned a bit of arrays and multi dimensional arrays as well. 
I also learned a bit about recursion but im not fully clear on it.
